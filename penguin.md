Penguins are flightless birds that live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life.
