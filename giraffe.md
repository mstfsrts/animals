The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its leopard-like coloring. The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.
